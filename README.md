# Machine Learning Projects README

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook code for three different machine learning projects. Each project focuses on predicting different aspects using linear regression.

## Project 1: House Price Prediction

### Overview
This project demonstrates house price prediction using linear regression. The scikit-learn library is used, and the Boston Housing dataset is utilized for training and testing the model. The project includes data preprocessing, model training, prediction, and evaluation using Mean Squared Error.

### Files
- `house_price_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanation for the house price prediction project.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Project 2: Wine Quality Prediction

### Overview
This project showcases wine quality prediction using linear regression. The scikit-learn library is used, and the wine quality dataset from scikit-learn is employed. The project covers data loading, feature selection, model training, prediction, and evaluation using Mean Squared Error. Note that linear regression is not the most suitable algorithm for classification tasks like this; it's better to use classification algorithms.

- `wine_quality_prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code and explanation for the wine quality prediction project.
- `README.md`: This README file.

## Project 3: Flower Species Prediction

### Overview
This project demonstrates flower species prediction using linear regression, although classification algorithms are more appropriate for this task. The scikit-learn library is used, and the Iris dataset is employed. The project includes data loading, feature selection, model training, prediction, and evaluation using accuracy score. Again, it's recommended to use classification algorithms for accurate species prediction.
